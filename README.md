CVars:

"chatping_enable" (default "1"):
Enables chatpinging.

"chatping_sound" (default "default"):
If set to 'custom', allows you to play a custom sound. This sound must be a .wav file placed inside the 'garrysmod' folder, with the name "chatping_sound.wav".

"chatping_casesensitive" (default "0"):
Defines if the match between the message and your nick should be perfect regarding uppercase and lowercase letters. Disabled by default, so 'ACTUALLYNOTHING' is the same as 'actuallyNothing'.

"chatping_alias_enable" (default "0"):
Enables the player to select an alias for themselves.

"chatping_alias":
Defines a secondary keyword to trigger the addon's pingsound, besides the player's nickname. This can be used to set a more common nickname or shortcut for the player.
